The repository contains three directories: 
  -Imgs:contains input images for the FAST algorithm
  -Out: contains output images for the FAST algorithm
  -Src: contains source code for the FAST algorithm (shown in the figure below under the fast block), as well as a top level module, test bench file, and counters to perform pixel addressing.

The bitmap test bench was based off of contributions from a prior ECE532 project test bench (https://github.com/ngemily/sample-bmp-tb).
